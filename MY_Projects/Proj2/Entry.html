        <h3>END OF BEGINNING</h3>
        <h4>by Djo</h4>
        Just one more tear to cry<br>
        One teardrop from my eye<br>
        You better save it for<br>
        The middle of the night<br>
        When things aren't black and white<br>
        Enter, Troubadour<br>
        "Remember twenty-four?"<br>
        <br>
        And when I'm back in Chicago, I feel it<br>
        Another version of me, I was in it<br>
        I wave goodbye to the end of beginning<br>
        <br>
        This song has started now<br>
        And you're just finding out<br>
        Now isn't that a laugh?<br>
        A major sacrifice<br>
        But clueless at the time<br>
        Enter, Caroline<br>
        "Just trust me, you'll be fine"<br>
        <br>
        And when I'm back in Chicago, I feel it<br>
        Another version of me, I was in it<br>
        I wave goodbye to the end of beginning<br>
        (Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye)<br>
        You take the man out of the city, not the city out the man<br>
        You take the man out of the city, not the city out the man<br>
        You take the man out of the city, not the city out the man<br>
        You take the man out of the-<br>
        <br>
        And when I'm back in Chicago, I feel it<br>
        Another version of me, I was in it<br>
        Oh, I wave goodbye to the end of beginning<br>
        (Goodbye, goodbye)<br>
