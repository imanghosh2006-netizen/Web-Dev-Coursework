## Differences between Outlines and Borders

--> Outline is applied outside the box hence it is drawn around the element outside the border.
--> Using Outline Offset we can set space between the outline adn the edge of border of an element.
--> Borders can have varying widths on different sides while outlines have a uniform width.
--> Borders can have rounded corners using border radius while outlines generally can't on their own however they might shall also have rounded corners if the border of the element has that.
